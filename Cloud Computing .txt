Cloud Computing 

Cloud refers to a Network -> Internet
Cloud can provide Services over public and private networks

N/W -> LAN / WAN / MAN / VPN

LAN -> Local Area Network

WAN -> wide Area Network 

MAN -> Metropolitan Area Network

VPN -> Virtual Private Networks

Applications such as 
 email 
 web conferencing
 CRM

Cloud Computing :
 refers to manipulating
           configuring
           accessing 
Hardware 
Software
from remote places

Cloud Offers -> Data Storage
                Infrastructure
                Application

Deployment Models
  Public
  Private
  Hybrid
  Community

Service Models
  IAAS - Infrastructure As A Service
  PAAS - Platform as a Service
  SAAS - Software as a Service

XaaS - yet another service model
          Network as a Service
          Business as a Service
          Database as a Service  
          Strategy as a Service


Virtualization :
   Creating a VM over existing OS and Hardware is referred to as HW Virtualization
   VM's provide an environment that is logically separated from underlying Hardware

The machine on which the VM is created is known as Host Machine 
and VM is referred as Guest Machine
This VM is managed by software or firmware which is known as Hypervisor

Virtualization in Cloud
 
Containerization :
  Type of Virtualization in which all the components of an Appl. are bundled into a single image
  and can be run in isolated user space on same shared OS 
  Containers are Light Weight 
                 portable
                 highly conducive to automation
  ex : Docker Container

- Containerization is the Packaging together of Software code  with all its necessary
  components like
       libraries
       frameworks
       other dependancies

Container is basically a fully functional and portable computing environment
Package an Application in a container that can be moved across platforms and infra.


Benefits :
 - Lightweight
 - Portable
 - share the host machine


Docker Containers
  - is a runtime Instance of Docker Image
  - Can be created by instantiating the image
  - Docker Containers bundle an application along with all of its dependancies into a compact , light package

Docker Containers :
- Open Source 
- images are free 
Features
 - Containerization
 - image Management
 - Networking
 - Volumes 
 - Security
 - Scalability
 - Orchestration
 - Microservices Architecture
 - CI/CD
