Problem solving techniques and data structures
Quiz 1
Question: Which of the following is a linear data structure?
A) Binary Tree
B) Graph
C) Stack
D) AVL Tree
 
A stack is a linear data structure because elements are accessed in a sequential manner using LIFO
 
 
Quiz 2
Question: Which sorting algorithm is not stable?
A) Bubble Sort
B) Quick Sort
C) Merge Sort
D) Insertion Sort
Quick Sort is not stable because it does not preserve the relative order of equal elements.
 
 
Quiz 3
Question: Which of the following describes the 'Divide and Conquer' technique?
A) Dividing a problem into overlapping subproblems.
B) Dividing a problem into disjoint subproblems.
C) Using trial and error to find a solution.
D) Building a solution step-by-step and selecting the best choice at each step.
 
The “Divide and Conquer” technique breaks down a problem into smaller, non-overlapping subproblems. Solves each independently , and combines their solutions.
 
 
Quiz 4
Question: What is the main advantage of Dynamic Programming over Divide and Conquer?
A) It uses a heuristic approach to find the solution.
B) It handles overlapping subproblems efficiently.
C) It always finds the optimal solution.
D) It does not require recursion.
 
Dynamic programming stores results o overlapping subproblems to avoid redundant comptations.
 
 
Quiz 5
Question: Which of the following data structures works on the principle of FIFO (First In, First Out)?
A) Stack
B) Tree
C) Queue
D) Graph
 
Queue follows FIFO where the first element added is the first element to be removed.
 
 
Quiz 6
Question: In which traversal of a Binary Tree do we visit the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree?
A) Inorder
B) Preorder
C) Postorder
D) Level order
 
Preorder traversal visits in the sequence : Root, Left , Right
 
Quiz 7
Question: Which data structure is used to check if a string has balanced parentheses?
A) Queue
B) Stack
C) Tree
D) Graph
 
Stack efficiently tracks the opening and closing of parentheses using LIFO
 
 
Quiz 8
Question: Which sorting algorithm uses the "bubble up" technique to sort elements?
A) Selection Sort
B) Merge Sort
C) Quick Sort
D) Bubble Sort
 
Bubble Sort repeatedly swaps adjacent elements to “bubble” the largest element to its correct position.
 
 
Quiz 9
Question: What is the main characteristic of a binary search tree?
A) It has at most two children.
B) All nodes have the same value.
C) The left child is greater than the parent node.
D) The right child is always a leaf.
 
Each node in a binary search tree has up to two children
 
Quiz 10
Question: What does the 'Greedy Approach' ensure in problem-solving?
A) It guarantees the global optimal solution.
B) It guarantees a feasible but not necessarily optimal solution.
C) It divides the problem into smaller independent subproblems.
D) It always finds a solution using dynamic programming.
 
The greedy approach selects the locally optimal choice at each step, which may not lead to the global optimum.
