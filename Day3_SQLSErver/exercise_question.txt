Hexaware - Table Creation and Constraints Exercises
Exercise 1: Create a table with a Primary Key
Create a table named `students` with the following columns:
- `student_id` (INT) as the Primary Key
- `first_name` (VARCHAR(50))
- `last_name` (VARCHAR(50))
- `birth_date` (DATE)


Exercise 2: Create a table with a Foreign Key
Create a table named `enrollments` with the following columns:
- `enrollment_id` (INT) as the Primary Key
- `student_id` (INT) as a Foreign Key referencing `students(student_id)`
- `course_id` (INT)
- `enrollment_date` (DATE)


Exercise 3: Create a table with a CHECK constraint
Create a table named `courses` with the following columns:
- `course_id` (INT) as the Primary Key
- `course_name` (VARCHAR(100))
- `credits` (INT) with a CHECK constraint to allow only values 
between 1 and 6


Exercise 4: Create a table with a DEFAULT constraint
Create a table named `professors` with the following columns:
- `professor_id` (INT) as the Primary Key
- `first_name` (VARCHAR(50))
- `last_name` (VARCHAR(50))
- `department` (VARCHAR(50)) with a DEFAULT value of 'General'


Exercise 5: Create a table with multiple constraints
Create a table named `departments` with the following columns:
- `department_id` (INT) as the Primary Key
- `department_name` (VARCHAR(100)) UNIQUE
- `budget` (DECIMAL(10, 2)) with a CHECK constraint to allow only values greater than 0


Exercise 6: Create a table with a composite Primary Key
Create a table named `course_assignments` with the following columns:
- `professor_id` (INT) as part of the composite Primary Key
- `course_id` (INT) as part of the composite Primary Key
- `assignment_date` (DATE)


Exercise 7: Create a table with a Foreign Key referencing a composite Primary Key
Create a table named `class_schedules` with the following columns:
- `schedule_id` (INT) as the Primary Key
- `professor_id` (INT)
- `course_id` (INT)
- `schedule_date` (DATE)
- Add a Foreign Key constraint referencing `course_assignments(professor_id, course_id)`


Exercise 8: Create a table with NOT NULL constraints
Create a table named `classrooms` with the following columns:
- `classroom_id` (INT) as the Primary Key
- `building` (VARCHAR(50)) NOT NULL
- `room_number` (VARCHAR(10)) NOT NULL
